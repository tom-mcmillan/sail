# Testing MCP with Inspector - Production URLs

The MCP Inspector is running at:
http://localhost:6274/?MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=a38f83b809f34e8508656eb4fc5475ad00b957f9f2cde4cab61b7ed641cb0ba3

## Steps to Test:

1. **Open the Inspector URL** in your browser

2. **Configure Connection**:
   - Transport: Select **"HTTP"**
   - URL: `https://mcp.sailmcp.com/local-files-test-125866fe/mcp`
   - Click **"Connect"**

3. **OAuth Flow**:
   - You should be redirected to the OAuth authorization page
   - Complete the authentication
   - The Inspector should reconnect with the token

## Current Status:
- ✅ OAuth flow is working
- ✅ Server is running in production
- ❌ OAuth fix not deployed yet (tools/list still requires Bearer token)
- ⚠️ This means after OAuth, you might still see "NO PROVIDED TOOLS"

## What We're Testing:
1. Can the Inspector connect to the production URL?
2. Does the OAuth flow complete successfully?
3. What error messages do we see after authentication?

This will help us understand if the core issue is just the OAuth middleware fix that needs deployment.
