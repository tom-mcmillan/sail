# Sail MCP Test Scripts

This directory contains test scripts for validating the Sail MCP multi-source bundling functionality.

## Scripts

### test-mvp.js

Comprehensive test script that validates the entire multi-source MCP bundling MVP:

- Tests available adapter registration
- Creates single-source exchanges (baseline functionality)
- Creates bundled exchanges (main MVP feature)
- Verifies configuration and lists all exchanges
- Provides summary and next steps

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/test-mvp.js
```

**Expected Output:**
- âœ… All 4 adapter types available (local, github, google_drive, composite)
- âœ… Single-source exchange creation works
- âœ… Bundled exchange creation with multiple sources
- âœ… Proper configuration with source weights and types
- Generated MCP URLs ready for Claude AI integration

### test-bundled-exchange.js

Focused test script for creating bundled exchanges with GitHub and Google Drive sources.

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/test-bundled-exchange.js
```

## Integration with Claude AI

Once bundled exchanges are created, use the generated MCP URLs in Claude AI:

1. Copy the MCP URL from the test output (e.g., `https://mcp.sailmcp.com/investor-bundle-abc123/mcp`)
2. Add it as an MCP server in Claude AI web interface
3. Test cross-source search and content retrieval
4. Validate tools and prompts from all bundled sources

## MVP Architecture

The bundled exchange MVP enables:

- **GitHub Integration**: Repository files, issues, pull requests
- **Google Drive Integration**: Documents, spreadsheets, presentations  
- **Local File Integration**: Server-side file access
- **Composite Bundling**: Unified search across all sources
- **Production Deployment**: Cloud Run infrastructure

## Required Credentials

For production use, replace demo tokens with real credentials:

- GitHub: Personal access token with repo permissions
- Google Drive: OAuth access token with drive.readonly scope
- Local: Valid server file paths

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Multi-source adapter implementation
2. âœ… Bundled exchange API endpoints  
3. âœ… Production deployment pipeline
4. ðŸ”„ Claude AI integration testing
5. ðŸ“‹ Real credential configuration
6. ðŸ“ˆ Performance optimization and caching
