## How Your Family Would Use It

Once set up, anyone with access can ask natural questions like:

- *"Find Mom's research notes about renewable energy"*
- *"Show me all the family budget spreadsheets"*
- *"What issues are open in Dad's coding project?"*
- *"Get the latest version of our vacation planning document"*

## Quick Setup Steps

1. **Install dependencies:** `npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk googleapis @octokit/rest`

2. **Set up credentials:**
   - Google: Service account JSON file
   - GitHub: Personal access token

3. **Run the servers:**
   ```bash
   node local-documents-mcp-server.js ./documents
   node google-drive-mcp-server.js ./credentials.json  
   node github-repo-mcp-server.js <token> <owner> <repo>
   ```

4. **Configure your MCP client** (like Claude Desktop) to connect to these servers

## Security & Privacy

- **Local documents** stay on your machine
- **Google Drive** uses read-only access with service accounts
- **GitHub** uses personal access tokens with minimal required permissions
- All can be restricted to specific folders/repositories

This creates a powerful, AI-accessible knowledge base that your family and collaborators can query naturally while maintaining proper access controls. The setup guide includes everything needed for deployment, security considerations, and troubleshooting.
