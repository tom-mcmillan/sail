Sample MCP Server for ChatGPT Deep Research
This is a sample Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to work with ChatGPT's Deep Research feature. It provides semantic search through OpenAI's Vector Store API and document retrieval capabilities, demonstrating how to build custom MCP servers that can extend ChatGPT with company-specific knowledge and tools.

Features
Search Tool: Semantic search using OpenAI Vector Store API
Fetch Tool: Complete document retrieval by ID with full content and metadata
SSE Transport: Server-Sent Events transport for real-time communication with ChatGPT
Sample Data: Includes 5 sample documents covering various technical topics
MCP Compliance: Follows OpenAI's MCP specification for deep research integration
Requirements
Python 3.8+
fastmcp (>=2.9.0)
uvicorn (>=0.34.3)
openai (Python SDK for vector store search)
pydantic (dependency of fastmcp)
Installation
Install the required dependencies:
pip install fastmcp uvicorn openai
Set up your OpenAI API key:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
Run the MCP server:
python main.py
The server will start on http://0.0.0.0:8000 with SSE transport enabled.

Usage
Connecting to ChatGPT Deep Research
Access ChatGPT Settings: Go to ChatGPT settings
Navigate to Connectors: Click on the "Connectors" tab
Add MCP Server: Add your server URL: http://your-domain:8000/sse/
Test Connection: The server should appear as available for deep research
Server Endpoints
SSE Endpoint: http://0.0.0.0:8000/sse/ - Main MCP communication endpoint
Health Check: Server logs will show successful startup and tool registration
Available Tools
Search Tool
Purpose: Find relevant documents using OpenAI Vector Store semantic search
Input: Search query string (natural language works best)
Output: List of matching documents from vector store with ID, title, and text snippet
Usage: ChatGPT will use this to find semantically relevant documents from your vector store
Requirements: Requires valid OpenAI API key and vector store access
Fetch Tool
Purpose: Retrieve complete document content from OpenAI Vector Store or local storage
Input: File ID from vector store (file-xxx) or local document ID
Output: Full document content with complete text and metadata
Usage: ChatGPT will use this to get complete document content for detailed analysis and citations
Requirements: Requires valid file IDs from vector store search results
Vector Store Integration
The server is configured to search vector store vs_682552f3ab90819185d4b99adcae7a07 which contains documents like:

Palantir 10-Q financial reports
Other documents uploaded to your OpenAI vector store
The server uses only OpenAI Vector Store APIs for both search and content retrieval - no local fallback data.

Customization
Using Your Own Vector Store
Update Vector Store ID: Change VECTOR_STORE_ID in main.py to your vector store ID

Upload Documents: Use OpenAI's API to upload documents to your vector store

Document Structure: Each document should include:

{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "title": "Document Title",
  "text": "Short description or excerpt",
  "content": "Full document content",
  "url": "https://optional-source-url.com",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "document_category",
    "author": "Author Name",
    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "tags": "comma,separated,tags"
  }
}
Restart Server: The server loads data at startup, so restart after making changes

Modifying Search Logic
The search function in main.py can be customized for:

Different vector store IDs or multiple vector stores
Custom result filtering and ranking
Additional metadata processing from vector store results
Custom content snippet length and formatting
Deployment
Local Development
The server runs locally on port 8000 and is accessible for testing with ChatGPT.

Production Deployment
For production use:

Use HTTPS: Ensure your server has SSL/TLS certificates
Authentication: Consider adding OAuth or API key authentication
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting for production traffic
Monitoring: Add logging and monitoring for server health
Scaling: Consider load balancing for high-traffic scenarios
Tunneling for Local Testing
If running locally and need external access, use tunneling tools like:

# Using ngrok
ngrok http 8000
# Using cloudflare tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
Architecture
This MCP server uses:

FastMCP: Simplified MCP protocol implementation
Uvicorn: ASGI server for HTTP/SSE transport
OpenAI Vector Store: Semantic search and content retrieval through OpenAI's API
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Server won't start: Check if port 8000 is already in use
ChatGPT can't connect: Ensure the server URL is correct and accessible
No search results: Verify your OpenAI API key and vector store ID are correct
Vector store errors: Check that the vector store exists and contains documents
Tools not appearing: Verify the server is running and MCP protocol is working
Debugging
Check server logs for detailed error messages
Use curl to test the SSE endpoint: curl http://localhost:8000/sse/
Test OpenAI API key: python -c "from openai import OpenAI; OpenAI().models.list()"
Verify vector store exists: Check OpenAI dashboard or API
Verify vector store contains documents and files
Contributing
This is a sample implementation. To extend it:

Add more sophisticated search algorithms
Implement database storage for larger datasets
Add authentication and security features
Create additional MCP tools beyond search and fetch
