Overview
This is a sample Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to integrate with ChatGPT's Deep Research feature. The application provides search and document retrieval capabilities for a knowledge base through a FastMCP server implementation. It serves as a reference implementation for building custom MCP servers that can extend ChatGPT with company-specific knowledge and tools.

System Architecture
The application follows a simple server-based architecture:

Backend Framework: FastMCP (Model Context Protocol implementation)
Runtime: Python 3.11 with uvicorn ASGI server
Transport: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication
Data Storage: In-memory storage with JSON file loading
Deployment: Single-process server running on port 8000
Key Components
1. MCP Server (main.py)
Purpose: Main application entry point implementing MCP protocol
Key Functions:
load_sample_data(): Loads documents from JSON file into memory
create_server(): Configures FastMCP server with tools
Architecture Decision: Uses FastMCP library for simplified MCP implementation
Rationale: FastMCP abstracts away protocol complexity while maintaining full MCP compatibility
2. Sample Data (sample_data.json)
Purpose: Static knowledge base with sample documents
Structure: Array of document records with metadata
Fields: id, title, text, content, url, metadata (category, author, date, tags)
Architecture Decision: JSON file for simple data storage
Rationale: Demonstrates data structure without database complexity
3. Configuration Files
.replit: Defines Python 3.11 environment and workflow automation
pyproject.toml: Python project dependencies (fastmcp, uvicorn)
uv.lock: Dependency lock file for reproducible builds
Data Flow
Server Startup:

Load sample data from JSON file into memory
Create lookup dictionary for fast document retrieval
Initialize FastMCP server with search and fetch tools
Search Operations:

Accept keyword-based search queries
Search across document titles, content, and metadata
Return matching document summaries
Fetch Operations:

Accept document ID requests
Return complete document with full content and metadata
Provide fast retrieval through in-memory lookup
MCP Communication:

Use Server-Sent Events for real-time communication
Follow MCP protocol for tool invocation and responses
External Dependencies
Core Dependencies
fastmcp (>=2.9.0): MCP protocol implementation
uvicorn (>=0.34.3): ASGI server for hosting
pydantic: Data validation (indirect dependency)
Development Environment
Python 3.11: Runtime environment
Nix: Package management and environment reproducibility
Deployment Strategy
Development Deployment
Platform: Replit environment with Nix package management
Process: Single uvicorn server process
Port: 8000 (configured in workflow)
Auto-restart: Enabled through Replit workflow configuration
Production Considerations
Scaling: Currently single-process, would need load balancing for production
Data Persistence: JSON file storage suitable for read-only scenarios
Security: No authentication implemented (would need to add for production)
Architecture Decision: In-Memory Storage
Problem: Need fast document retrieval for MCP operations
Solution: Load all documents into memory at startup
Pros: Fast lookup times, simple implementation
Cons: Limited by available memory, data lost on restart
Alternative Considered: Database storage (would add complexity for sample)
Recent Changes
June 24, 2025: Fixed deployment port configuration and URL formatting
Updated server port from 5000 back to 8000 to match deployment requirements
Reconfigured workflow to expect port 8000 instead of 5000
Resolved deployment failure caused by port forwarding mismatch
Fixed search function URL formatting to match fetch function format
Both search and fetch now return proper OpenAI platform URLs for citations
Server now properly configured for Autoscale deployments on port 8000
MCP server successfully running and ready for deployment
