# Session Notes: Universal MCP Architecture Implementation

## Date: June 29, 2025

### Overview
Successfully implemented a universal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server architecture that supports both Claude and ChatGPT from a single endpoint. The system uses an adapter pattern for extensible knowledge stores and follows the official MCP SDK specifications.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Universal MCP Server Architecture ✅
- **Created adapter pattern** for extensible knowledge stores
  - `KnowledgeStoreAdapter` base class
  - `LocalFileSystemAdapter` implementation
  - `AdapterRegistry` for managing adapters
- **Implemented `UniversalMCPServer`** using official MCP SDK
  - Session-based state management
  - Support for both SSE and Streamable HTTP transports
  - Proper request routing and error handling

### 2. Database Schema Updates ✅
- Added `knowledge_type` column to exchanges table
- Created migration system for existing databases
- Added proper indexes for performance

### 3. Universal Endpoint Format ✅
- Changed from `/mcp/{slug}` to `/{slug}` format
- Single URL works for both Claude and ChatGPT
- Cleaner, more intuitive API design

### 4. Frontend Updates ✅
- Updated to support `knowledge_type` field
- Modified to display universal endpoint URLs
- Fixed metadata (title, description) for production

```

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Search Tool**: Content-based search across files
2. **Fetch Tool**: Retrieve full file contents
3. **List Files Tool**: Browse available documents
4. **Session Management**: Maintains MCP server state between requests
5. **Transport Auto-detection**: Handles both Claude (SSE) and ChatGPT (HTTP)

## Current Status

### What's Working ✅
- Universal MCP architecture fully implemented
- Frontend deployed to Vercel at sailmcp.com
- Website user journey functional
- Exchange creation through web interface
- Local testing shows all MCP tools working

### Issues Identified ❌
1. **Backend Deployment**: Cloud Run still has old code without universal MCP
2. **URL Mismatch**: Frontend shows Cloud Run URL instead of sailmcp.com format
3. **Slow Response**: Cloud Run cold starts taking 19+ seconds
4. **Connection Error**: Claude can't connect due to outdated endpoint

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Deploy Backend to Cloud Run
```bash
# Build and push Docker image
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/sail-backend

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy sail-backend \
  --image gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/sail-backend \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

### 2. Configure Routing
- Set up proper domain routing:
  - `sailmcp.com/api/*` → Backend API
  - `sailmcp.com/{slug}` → Universal MCP endpoints
  - `sailmcp.com/*` → Frontend

### 3. Update Environment Variables
- Frontend: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://sailmcp.com/api`
- Backend: `BASE_URL=https://sailmcp.com`

## Testing Results

### Successful Local Tests
```bash
# Initialize
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/test-documents-5c856b90" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", ...}'

# List tools
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/test-documents-5c856b90" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: [session-id]" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list"}'

# Search
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/test-documents-5c856b90" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: [session-id]" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "search", "arguments": {"query": "MCP"}}}'
```

### Production Issues
- Claude connection error: "Please check your server URL and make sure your server handles auth correctly"
- Root cause: Backend on Cloud Run doesn't have universal MCP code

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Single Endpoint**: One URL serves all MCP clients
2. **Extensible**: Easy to add new knowledge stores (GitHub, Google Drive, Zotero)
3. **Standards Compliant**: Uses official MCP SDK
4. **Session Management**: Proper state handling for complex interactions
5. **Future Proof**: Ready for additional MCP capabilities

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript throughout
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Follows MCP protocol specifications
- ✅ Production-ready logging

## Deployment Summary

### What Was Deployed
- ✅ Frontend to Vercel (automatic via GitHub)
- ❌ Backend to Cloud Run (needs manual deployment)

### Deployment Commands Needed
```bash
# 1. Build Docker image
cd /Users/thomasmcmillan/projects/sail/backend
docker build -t gcr.io/sail-mcp/sail-backend .

# 2. Push to GCR
docker push gcr.io/sail-mcp/sail-backend

# 3. Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy sail-backend \
  --image gcr.io/sail-mcp/sail-backend \
  --region us-central1 \
  --platform managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars NODE_ENV=production
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always deploy backend changes** when they're needed for frontend
2. **Test production endpoints** not just local
3. **Consider cold start times** for serverless deployments
4. **Verify routing configuration** for domain-level access
5. **Check actual deployed code** matches expectations

## Final Notes

The universal MCP architecture is a significant improvement over the previous design. Once the backend is properly deployed to Cloud Run, users will have a seamless experience creating and using MCP servers with both Claude and ChatGPT. The adapter pattern ensures easy extensibility for future knowledge store types.
