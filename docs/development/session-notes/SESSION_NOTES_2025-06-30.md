# Session Notes - June 30, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on fixing OAuth authentication issues for the Sail MCP platform when integrating with Claude.ai and ChatGPT. The main issue was "There was an error connecting to Test server. Please check your server URL and make sure your server handles auth correctly."

## Architecture Context
- **Frontend**: Next.js on Vercel (`www.sailmcp.com`)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express on Google Cloud Run (`mcp.sailmcp.com`)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Google Cloud SQL
- **MCP URLs**: Format is `https://mcp.sailmcp.com/{slug}/mcp`

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed OAuth Route Structure
**Problem**: OAuth consent route was returning "Route not found"
**Root Cause**: Routes were defined as `/oauth/consent` in `oauth-consent.ts` but the router was mounted under `/oauth` in `server.ts`, creating a double prefix: `/oauth/oauth/consent`
**Solution**: Changed routes in `oauth-consent.ts` from `/oauth/consent` to `/consent`
```typescript
// Before
router.get('/oauth/consent', ...)
// After  
router.get('/consent', ...)
```

### 2. Deployed OAuth Fix
Successfully deployed the OAuth route fix to Cloud Run:
- Built Docker image: `gcr.io/sail-mcp-production/sail-backend:oauth-fix-amd64`
- Deployed as revision: `sail-backend-00028-ftd`
- OAuth consent screen now loads successfully at `/oauth/consent`

### 3. Identified Database Issue
**Problem**: OAuth consent fails with "Internal server error" when clicking "Approve"
**Root Cause**: OAuth clients (claudeai, chatgpt) don't exist in the production database
**Evidence**: Logs show "OAuth client query result: 0 rows"

### 4. Created OAuth Client Setup
Created two solutions:
1. **TypeScript script** (`scripts/setup-oauth-clients.ts`) - Successfully ran locally but connected to local DB
2. **SQL script** (`scripts/insert-oauth-clients.sql`) - Ready to run on production

## What Failed and Why

### 1. OAuth Client Registration
**Issue**: OAuth clients exist in local database but not in production Cloud SQL
**Why**: The setup script ran against local PostgreSQL instead of production
**Next Steps**: Need to execute the SQL script on production Cloud SQL instance

### 2. Redis Connection Errors
**Issue**: Logs flooded with "Redis error: Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379"
**Why**: Redis is trying to connect to localhost instead of a cloud Redis instance
**Impact**: Makes debugging difficult due to log noise
**Temporary Fix**: Set `REDIS_URL=""` to disable Redis

### 3. Cloud SQL Direct Connection
**Issue**: Cannot connect directly to Cloud SQL due to IPv6 restrictions
**Error**: "CloudSQL Second Generation doesn't support IPv6 networks"
**Attempted Solution**: Installed Cloud SQL Proxy v1 but didn't complete the connection

## Critical Information for Next Engineer

### 1. Current State
- OAuth consent screen works (GET `/oauth/consent`)
- OAuth approval fails because clients don't exist in production DB
- Redis is temporarily disabled to reduce log noise

### 2. Immediate Next Steps
1. **Insert OAuth clients into production database**:
   ```sql
   -- Use the script at: backend/scripts/insert-oauth-clients.sql
   -- Connect via Cloud SQL Proxy or Cloud Console
   ```

2. **Re-enable Redis with proper configuration**:
   - Either set up Cloud Memorystore
   - Or properly configure REDIS_URL to point to a cloud Redis instance
   - Current issue: Redis is trying to connect to localhost

3. **Test OAuth flow end-to-end**:
   - Create an exchange at www.sailmcp.com
   - Copy the MCP URL (format: `https://mcp.sailmcp.com/{slug}/mcp`)
   - Add to Claude.ai settings
   - Complete OAuth flow

### 3. Environment Variables
Current production env vars on Cloud Run:
- `BASE_URL=https://mcp.sailmcp.com`
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `FRONTEND_URL=https://frontend-{deployment-id}.vercel.app`
- `REDIS_URL=""` (temporarily disabled)
- `DATABASE_URL` is NOT set as env var (likely baked into Docker image)

### 4. Database Access
- **Instance**: `sail-postgres-prod` in `us-central1-c`
- **IP**: `34.135.247.25`
- **Database**: Likely `sail_production` or `sail`
- **Access Method**: Use Cloud SQL Proxy or Cloud Console

### 5. Known Working Endpoints
- ✅ `https://mcp.sailmcp.com/health`
- ✅ `https://mcp.sailmcp.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- ✅ `https://mcp.sailmcp.com/oauth/consent` (GET only)
- ❌ `https://mcp.sailmcp.com/oauth/consent` (POST fails - needs OAuth clients)

### 6. Debug Commands
```bash
# Check logs without Redis noise
gcloud run services logs read sail-backend --region=us-central1 --limit=50 | grep -v "Redis error"

# Test OAuth consent
curl -s "https://mcp.sailmcp.com/oauth/consent?client_id=claudeai&redirect_uri=https://claude.ai/oauth/callback&response_type=code&scope=mcp:read"

# Deploy new version
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --push -t gcr.io/sail-mcp-production/sail-backend:new-tag .
gcloud run deploy sail-backend --image gcr.io/sail-mcp-production/sail-backend:new-tag --region=us-central1
```

### 7. OAuth Client Configuration
The OAuth clients need these exact configurations:
- **Claude AI**:
  - ID: `claudeai`
  - Redirect URIs: `["https://claude.ai/auth/callback","https://claude.ai/integrations/callback","https://claude.ai/oauth/callback"]`
  - Scopes: `['mcp:read', 'mcp:write']`
  - Public client: `true`
  
- **ChatGPT**:
  - ID: `chatgpt`
  - Redirect URIs: `["https://chat.openai.com/aip/oauth/callback","https://chat.openai.com/auth/callback","https://chat.openai.com/oauth/callback"]`
  - Scopes: `['mcp:read', 'mcp:write']`
  - Public client: `true`

## Summary
The OAuth consent flow is 90% working. The only remaining issue is inserting the OAuth client records into the production database. Once that's done, the Claude/ChatGPT integration should work fully. The architecture is sound, the routes are correct, and the OAuth implementation follows RFC standards.
