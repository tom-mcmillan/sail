Building MCP servers for deep research
======================================

Build an MCP server to use with deep research via API or ChatGPT.

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open protocol that's becoming the industry standard for extending AI models with additional tools and knowledge. Remote MCP servers can be used to connect models over the Internet to new data sources and capabilities.

In this guide, we'll cover how to build a remote MCP server that reads data from a private data source (a [vector store](/docs/guides/retrieval)) and makes it available to deep research models in ChatGPT via connectors, and [via API](/docs/guides/deep-research).

Configure a data source
-----------------------

You can use data from any source to power a remote MCP server, but for simplicity, we will use [vector stores](/docs/guides/retrieval) in the OpenAI API. Begin by uploading a PDF document to a new vector store - [you can use this public domain 19th century book about cats](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/cats.pdf) for an example.

You can upload files and create a vector store [in the dashboard here](/storage/vector_stores), or you can create vector stores and upload files via API. [Follow the vector store guide](/docs/guides/retrieval) to set up a vector store and upload a file to it.

Make a note of the vector store's unique ID to use in the example to follow.

Create an MCP server
--------------------

Next, let's create a deep research-compatible remote MCP server that will do search queries against our vector store, and be able to return document content for files with a given ID.

In this example, we are going to build our MCP server using Python and [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp). A full implementation of the server will be provided at the end of this section, along with instructions for running it on [Replit](https://replit.com/).

Note that there are a number of other MCP server frameworks you can use in a variety of programming languages. Whichever framework you use though, the tool definitions in your server will need to conform to the shape described here.

Your MCP server must implement two tools to work with deep research - `search` and `fetch`.

### `search` tool

The search tool is used by deep research models (and others) to return a list of possibly relevant search results from the data set exposed by your MCP server.

_Arguments:_

A single query string.

_Returns:_

An array of objects with the following properties:

*   `id` - a unique ID for the document or search result item
*   `title` - a string title for the search result item
*   `text` - a relevant snippet of text for the search terms
*   `url` - a URL to the document or search result item. Useful for citing specific resources in research.

### `fetch` tool

The fetch tool is used to retrieve the full contents of a search result document or item.

_Arguments:_

A string which is a unique identifier for the search document.

_Returns:_

A single object with the following properties:

*   `id` - a unique ID for the document or search result item
*   `title` - a string title for the search result item
*   `text` - The full text of the document or item
*   `url` - a URL to the document or search result item. Useful for citing specific resources in research.
*   `metadata` - an optional key/value pairing of data about the result

### Server example

An easy way to try out this example MCP server is using [Replit](https://replit.com/). You can configure this sample application with your own API credentials and vector store information to try it yourself.

Replit setup

On Replit, you will need to configure two environment variables in the "Secrets" UI:

*   `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your standard OpenAI API key
*   `VECTOR_STORE_ID` - The unique identifier of a vector store that can be used for search - the one you created earlier.

On free Replit accounts, server URLs are active for as long as the editor is active, so while you are testing, you'll need to keep the browser tab open. You can get a URL for your MCP server by clicking on the chainlink icon:

![replit configuration](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/replit.png)

In the long dev URL, ensure it ends with `/sse/`, which is the server-sent events (streaming) interface to the MCP server. This is the URL you will use to configure deep research both via API and ChatGPT. An example Replit URL looks like:

```text
https://777xxx.janeway.replit.dev/sse/
```

Test and connect your MCP server
--------------------------------

You can test your MCP server with a deep research model [in the prompts dashboard](/prompts). Create a new prompt, or edit an existing one, and add a new MCP tool to the prompt configuration. Remember that MCP servers used via API for deep research have to be configured with no approval required.

![prompts configuration](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/prompts_mcp.png)

Once you have configured your MCP server, you can chat with a model using it via the Prompts UI.

![prompts chat](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/chat_prompts_mcp.png)

You can test the MCP server using the Responses API directly with a request like this one:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "o4-mini-deep-research",
  "input": [
    {
      "role": "developer",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "input_text",
          "text": "You are a research assistant that searches MCP servers to find answers to your questions."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "input_text",

      "allowed_tools": [
        "search",
        "fetch"
      ],
      "require_approval": "never"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Handle authentication

As someone building a custom remote MCP server, authorization and authentication help you protect your data. We recommend using OAuth and [dynamic client registration](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization#2-4-dynamic-client-registration). To learn more about the protocol's authentication, read the [MCP user guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#authentication-and-authorization) or see the [authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization).

After connecting your custom remote MCP server in ChatGPT, users in your workspace will get an OAuth flow to your application.

### Connect in ChatGPT

1.  Import your remote MCP servers directly in [ChatGPT settings](https://chatgpt.com/#settings).
2.  Connect your server in the **Connectors** tab. It should now be visible in the composer > deep research tool. You may have to add the server as a source.
3.  Test your server by running some prompts.

Risks and safety
----------------

Custom MCP servers enable you to connect your ChatGPT workspace to external applications, which allows ChatGPT to access, send and receive data, and take action in these applications. Please note that custom MCP servers are not developed or verified by OpenAI, and are third-party services that are subject to their own terms and conditions.

If you come across a malicious MCP server, please report it to [security@openai.com](mailto:security@openai.com).

### Connecting to trusted servers

Be careful with which custom MCP servers you add to your ChatGPT workspace. Currently, we only support deep research with custom MCP servers in ChatGPT, meaning the only tools intended to be available within the remote MCP servers are **search** and **document retrieval**. However, risks still apply even with this narrow scope.

We recommend that you do not connect to a custom MCP server unless you know and trust the underlying application. For example, pick official servers hosted by the service providers themselves (e.g., we recommend connecting to the Stripe server hosted by Stripe themselves on mcp.stripe.com, instead of a custom Stripe MCP server hosted by a third party). Because there aren't many official remote MCP servers today, you may be tempted to use a MCP server hosted by an organization that doesn't operate that server and simply proxies requests to that service via an API. If you do this, be extra careful in doing your due diligence on these unofficial MCP servers, and only connect once you’ve carefully reviewed how they use your data and have verified that you can trust the server. When building and connecting to your own MCP server, double check that it's the correct server.

Malicious MCP servers may include hidden instructions (prompt injections) designed to make ChatGPT behave unexpectedly. While OpenAI has implemented built-in safeguards to help detect and block these threats, it's essential to carefully review and ensure connections are established only with trusted servers.

When connecting to MCP servers that define their own tool definitions, your organization may get requests for data that you do not want or intend to share with the host of that MCP server. Before connecting to any MCP server, review the type of data being shared carefully and robustly.

MCP servers may update tool behavior unexpectedly, potentially leading to unintended or malicious behavior.

### Building servers

Be careful with the data you allow access to. Your remote MCP server permits others to connect OpenAI to your services and allows OpenAI to access, send and receive data, and take action in these services. Avoid putting any sensitive information in the JSON for your tools, and avoid storing any sensitive information from ChatGPT users accessing your remote MCP server.

As someone building an MCP server, don't put anything malicious in your tool definitions. At this time, we only support search and document retrieval.
